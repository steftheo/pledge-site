                        Because your privacy is very important to us, we want you to understand our practices with regard to collecting and using your information both online and offline and the steps we take to safeguard it.

                        When this Privacy Policy uses the term “Personally Identifiable Information” it refers to information that lets us know the specifics of whom you are and can be used to identify, contact or locate you.
