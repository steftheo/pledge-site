                        Find My Pledge or on Theo’s website, including but limited to theotechnologies.co (collectively, the “App”).</p>

                    <h4>Your Acceptance Of These Terms And Conditions.</h4>
                    <p>
                        These terms and conditions form a legally-binding agreement between you and Theo. When you use the App, you will be bound by all of the terms, conditions and restrictions in these Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy. Please read them carefully.
                        You acknowledge that you download the App for free (and while there is additional content and services available for purchase within the App (“In-App Purchases”), such In-App Purchases are entirely voluntary and not required to
                        utilize the App).
                    </p>

                    <h4>Grant of Limited License.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Subject to your agreement and continuing compliance with these Terms of Use and Theo’s policies, Theo grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited license subject to the limitations below to access and use the App

                    <h4>Login Information and Your Account.</h4>
                    <p>
                        In order to use the App, you must sign in using your Facebook login. If you do so, you authorize us to access and use certain Facebook account information, including but not limited to your public Facebook profile and information about Facebook friends
                        you might share in common with other users of the App. For more information regarding the information we collect from you and how we use it, please consult our Privacy Policy and the privacy and account information of Facebook.

                        When you register with the App we will ask you to provide us with certain contact and personal details. If you wish to purchase any of the Services, we will also ask you to provide us with your payment details. False, incorrect, or outdated information
                        may prevent you from registering and impair our ability to provide you with the Services and to contact you. Theo will explicitly indicate the fields for mandatory completion. If you do not enter the requisite personal information
                        in these fields, you will not be able to register with the Services. Our use of your Personal Data is subject to our <a href="private-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To login, you must use your Facebook account. Theo may also establish and require from time to time additional or different means of identification and authentication for logging in and accessing your account, or for accessing other certain services of
                        Theo.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will maintain your password in absolute confidentiality and refrain from disclosing it to others. Make sure that you change your password frequently and at least once every six months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are fully accountable for any outcome resulting from your failure to provide true, accurate and complete details in the course of the registration process, and for any use or misuse of your account as a result of conveying your details to someone
                        else.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You shall not share your account or your Login Information, nor let anyone else access your account or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Login Information,
                        and you will be solely responsible for all uses of your Login Information, including any purchases, loss of In-App Purchases Purchases, or other changes to your account, whether or not authorized by you. Theo will not be responsible
                        for anything that happens through or to your account as a result of you allowing any third party to access your Login Information and/or account. Theo may remove or reclaim any usernames at any time and for any reason, including
                        but not limited to claims by a third party that a username violates the third party’s rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your account is for your personal use only. You specifically will not: (a) share your account credentials with anyone else, (b) sell, offer to sell, rent, lease, trade or otherwise transfer your account. You acknowledge that any purported transfers of
                        App accounts or In-App Purchases in violation of this Section, including but not limited to transfers in exchange for money or other compensation, are void and breach these Terms of Use, and that we have no responsibility to assist
                        you in connection with completing any such transaction. Theo may terminate or suspend your account and/or your right to access or use the App if we discover or reasonably believe that you have attempted to buy, sell, rent, lease,
                        license, or transfer your App account or associated In-App Purchases, or used or accessed an account or In-App Purchases transferred by another user, or linked to or otherwise endorsed or identified any websites, organizations,
                        or persons that attempt to buy, sell, rent, lease, license, or transfer accounts or In-App Purchases in violation of this Section.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Eligibility.</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are limitations on who may download and use the App. You may not download or use the App if you are under 18 years of age. If we learn that a user under 18 years of age is using the App despite this restriction, we will immediately delete their
                        account and all personal information we have related to their account. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, or under the age of majority where you live, you may not use the App unless your parent or legal guardian has reviewed
                        and agreed to these Terms of Use. The App is available for download from mobile application platform providers like Google Play or Apple iTunes Store {consider providing a link to each}, each of which may require you to maintain
                        an account with them which will be subject to the terms and conditions of their platform, in order to access and use the App.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Services.</h4>
                    <p>
                        The App provides location-related services, including but not limited to assisting members of fraternities, sororities, and other similar college organizations (“College Organizations”) to connect with other College Organization members (the “Services”).
                    </p>

                    <h4>Your Interactions With Other Users.</h4>
                    <p>
                        You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users with whom you interact through the App or as a result of the Services. Theo reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with any disputes concerning the App.
                        You will fully cooperate with us to investigate any suspected unlawful, fraudulent or improper activity, including without limitation granting Theo access to any portion of your account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have a dispute with one or more users, or any other interaction you believe may give rise to any claim, you release Theo (and our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual
                        and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you live in California, you waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by
                        him or her must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you live outside of California, you waive any other statute, law, or rule of similar effect in your jurisdiction.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Third Party Promotions and Links.</h4>
                    <p>
                        The App may contain advertisements and other promotional content from third parties, including links to third party websites or vendors (collectively “Third Party Promotions “), some of which may invite you to participate in promotional offers in return
                        for receiving optional services and/or In-App Purchases. Some of these Third Party Promotions may charge separate fees, which are not included in any fees that you may pay to Theo. Any separate charges or obligations you incur
                        in your dealings with such third parties are your responsibility. Theo makes no representation or warranty regarding any content, goods and/or services contained in such Third Party Promotions and will not be liable for any claim
                        relating thereto. Theo exercises no control over Third Party Promotions, and Theo has no responsibility for their content, goods, services, performance, operation, availability, business practices or policies. Theo is providing
                        these Third Party Promotions to you only as a convenience, and Theo does not imply any endorsement or recommendation of their content, goods, or services. If you decide to access any of these Third Party Promotions, you do so entirely
                        at your own risk. Third Party Promotions, including third party websites, may be subject to their own terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices.

                        This Agreement does not convey to you any ownership interest in or to the App or Services, but only a limited and revocable right of use in accordance with the terms of these Terms and Conditions. Nothing in these Terms and Conditions constitutes a waiver
                        of Theo’s Intellectual Property Rights under any law. Use of the App and Services in violation of the limited license granted hereunder will result in the termination of these Terms and Conditions and may expose you to claims for
                        damages. You will take all necessary steps to prevent any unauthorized disclosure or use of the App and Services, or any part thereof, by others.
                    </p>

                        Theo, and third parties on its behalf, implement information security systems and procedures to secure your personal information and to prevent unauthorized access to your account on the App and the Services and any information routed through or stored

                        IN NO EVENT SHALL THEO’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE BILLING PERIOD DURING WHICH THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM OCCURRED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THEO BE LIABLE TO ANYONE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,

                    </p>

                    <h4>Notice.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Theo may give you notice by means of a general notice on the App or by electronic mail to your e-mail address on record in Theo’s account information. Such notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the expiration of 48 hours after posting or 12 hours

                    </p>

                    <h4>Modification of Terms and Conditions.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Theo reserve the right to modify these Terms of Use from time to time by posting updated versions in the App or otherwise notifying you of changes through the App. Unless we state otherwise, changes are effective when we post or notify you of them. By

                    </p>

                    <h4>Miscellaneous.</h4>
                    <p>
                        This Agreement shall be exclusively governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions thereof, and any disputes, actions, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with these Terms
                        and Conditions or the Service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in the city of Miami, Florida. This Agreement comprises the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes
                        all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties regarding the subject matter contained herein. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is held by a court
                        of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the invalid or unenforceable provision, with all other provisions remaining in
                        full force and effect. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between the parties as a result of these Terms and Conditions or use of the App and the Services. The failure of Theo to enforce any
                        right or provision in these Terms and Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by Theo in writing. The section headings in these Terms and Conditions are included for
                        convenience only and shall take no part in the interpretation, or construing of these Terms and Conditions. “Including”, whether capitalized or not, means without limitation. This Agreement may not be assigned by you without the
                        prior written approval of Theo and any assignment without such prior written consent shall be void. Theo shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of Theo, including
                        without limitation any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or causes beyond Theo’s control, such as acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents,
                        strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Changes in Ownership.</h4>
                    <p>
                        If Theo undergoes a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, Theo may transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the successor organization in such transition.
                        If material changes to Theo’s privacy practices will occur as a result of the business transition, Theo will notify you and other users (in the manner described in Changes to Our Privacy Policy below) of the business transition
                        prior to transferring your personal information.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Survival.</h4>
                    <p>
                        The provisions of the intellectual property, disclaimer of warranty, limitation of liability, miscellaneous, and indemnification sections, shall survive the termination, or expiration of these Terms and Conditions.
                    </p>
